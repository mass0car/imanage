# Very Basic Stack UI

This application has been written to show the basic functions of the stack API. Please note that this application does not handle the errors thrown by the API. In order to create a simple application I learned the very basics of React JS in order to create this page. There are also no tests written for this application but in a real world example there would be a set of tests to go along with the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
